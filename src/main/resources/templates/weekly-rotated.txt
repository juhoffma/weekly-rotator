Hi Guys,

Thank you all very much for filling out last weeks weekly.

I have prepared the new weekly Report Document for this week. You can find it here:

Remember to adhere to the correct format. Details on the format can be found here: https://sites.google.com/pivotal.io/pa-wiki/sales-play/weekly-status?authuser=0

I have also added the information below:

# Why

The weekly status reports are key to providing leadership and executive staff insight into:

- Which accounts do we spend most of our time in?
- Which PAs are spending most of their time on an account?
- Has the activity been consistent? Or in spurts?
- How is the activity by play steps accounts?
- Where are we doing workshops and POCs?
- How is our activity at big $$ focus accounts?
- Other key questions like competition etc…
- All this data is parsed and fed into the PA Activity Dashboard (PAD).

Arni has recorded a lighting talk which explains how this data is being used.

# Weekly Entry Format

- POSITIVE / FLAT / NEGATIVE - Each customer interaction should be placed in a section based on outcome.
- #[COMPANY_NAME] - Name of the company.
- %[PLAY_STEP]  - See here for the sales play steps
- @[PA_NAME] - FirstnameLastname format
- *[PARTNER_NAME] - If working with a partner like Dell, VMware, Cognizant...
- Weekly Reporting Flow - Americas
- PAs to submit weekly report by COB Friday

PA Area Leaders to review and add comments to the weekly report, then submit an area summary by COB Monday.

# What Good Looks Like

Accounts with POSITIVE activity this week

#Fiserv - %AppE - @ChrisDelashmutt and @MichaelWright met with multiple members from the Digital channels architects team. It was planned as a deep dive meeting as they wanted to understand how .NET in PCF works. The lead architect John Doe had a ton of good questions which I think we fielded well. John Doe was not in favor of .NET on PCF last year. He said he was impressed with PCF’s .NET abilities and that we have come a long way with product maturity.  Next step is a hands on workshop with the dev team

# Tips/Tricks

- Do not use sub-bullets! Explain each interaction with a single bullet in paragraph form. This makes the report easier to parse and read. Keep in mind that our weekly status can exceed 50 pages.
- If a step is not in the play, use a descriptive word (Ex: #internalprep)
- If multiple people participated in an interaction, denote with additional @FirstnameLastname tags. There is no need to copy/paste multiple status entries for each PA.
- Be descriptive but no need to be very verbose. We care about: 1) Who did you meet: name and title. 2) Purpose of meeting. 3) What was done in meeting. 4) Meeting outcome - did we move the account in a positive, negative or flat way.
- If you have Competitive Trends, Product Trend Updates or Other Noteworthy Items, please document under your area leader section. Your PA lead will read and possibly comment on your valuable intel.

Thanks for filling it out by Friday EoB.
